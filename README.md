An AI-powered educational assistant designed to support Sinhala medium students and teachers.  
This project combines **mobile learning apps**, **AI services (OCR, STT, RAG, grading)**, and **infrastructure tools** to create a complete ecosystem for Sinhala education.

Team Responsibilities

The work is divided into four main functional areas. Each member is responsible for one part and supports the integration work.

1. Sinhala Document Processing (OCR + Preprocessing)

Handles printed and handwritten Sinhala text.
• Image cleaning
• Sinhala OCR
• Text normalization

2. Sinhala Q&A and Summaries (RAG Pipeline)

Takes student questions as text, searches resources, and produces answers tied to teacher notes.
• Embeddings
• Semantic search
• Source-bound answers
• Summaries

3. Voice-Based Q&A (Speech Recognition + Voice Output)

Handles Sinhala voice queries using speech recognition models and generates spoken answers.
• Voice capture
• Sinhala ASR
• Intent detection
• Text-to-speech

4. Automatic Answer Evaluation (IT22003478 – Miyuri)

Grades Sinhala student answers using uploaded resources.
• OCR for answer images if needed

# **📘 Component Workflows (Detailed Descriptions)**

This section explains how each major component of the Sinhala Ed Assistant works.
Each workflow focuses on the main steps the system follows when handling a user request.

---

# **1. Sinhala Document Processing Workflow (OCR + Embeddings)**

This module prepares printed or handwritten Sinhala educational content so the rest of the system can use it.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Document Input**
   A student or teacher uploads a scanned page, image, or handwritten note.

2. **Preprocessing**
   The system applies noise removal, resizing, deskewing, and contrast correction to improve recognition quality.

3. **Sinhala OCR Execution**
   The processed image is passed through a Sinhala-trained OCR engine.
   Output: raw Sinhala text.

4. **Text Normalization**
   Cleaning steps include Unicode fixes, spacing correction, and handling compound characters.

5. **Embedding Generation**
   The cleaned text is converted to semantic vectors using Sinhala-compatible embedding models.

6. **Storage in Vector Database**
   The embeddings and metadata are stored for later retrieval during Q&A, summarization, or answer evaluation.

---

# **2. Resource-Based Q&A and Summary Workflow (RAG Pipeline)**

This module retrieves relevant passages from teacher materials and produces source-grounded answers or summaries.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **User Input (Sinhala Text Query)**
   The student types a question into the mobile app.

2. **Query Normalization**
   The text is standardized to reduce Sinhala spelling and morphology variations.

3. **Query Embedding**
   The normalized question is converted into a semantic vector.

4. **Hybrid Retrieval**
   The system performs:

   - **BM25 retrieval** for keyword-exact passages
   - **Dense retrieval** for semantic matching
   - **Re-ranking** using pseudo-questions (via QuIM-style method)

5. **Context Selection**
   The top-ranked passages from teacher resources are selected.

6. **Answer / Summary Generation**
   The model generates:

   - **Source-bound answer**, or
   - **Condensed summary**, depending on user intent.

7. **Output Delivery**
   The mobile app receives the answer with optional reference indicators.

---

# **3. Voice-Based Q&A Workflow (Speech Input → Text → Answer → Display Output)**

This module handles Sinhala voice questions with accent-aware processing.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Voice Capture**
   The user speaks a Sinhala question using the app microphone.

2. **Speech Recognition (ASR)**
   The audio is transcribed into Sinhala text using a fine-tuned Whisper model.

3. **Intent Classification**
   The system identifies whether the user requests:

   - a direct answer
   - or a summary.

4. **RAG Processing**
   The recognized text is forwarded to the RAG module for retrieval and answer generation.

5. **Sinhala Text Response**
   The system produces a source-grounded answer.

6. **Output Delivery**
   The app displays the text response.

---

# **4. Automatic Answer Evaluation Workflow**

This module grades student answers based on semantic similarity to teacher-provided material.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Answer Submission**
   A student inputs an answer as typed text or uploads a photo.

2. **OCR (Only for Images)**
   The image is processed and converted into text using the same OCR pipeline used for documents.

3. **Text Preparation**
   The extracted text is cleaned and split into segments.

4. **Embedding Generation**
   Embeddings are produced for:

   - the student answer
   - the expected answer
   - the key points from teacher notes

5. **Semantic Comparison**
   The system checks:

   - matched concepts
   - partially correct ideas
   - missing points
   - irrelevant or incorrect statements

6. **Rubric-Based Evaluation**
   Scores are calculated based on:

   - coverage
   - accuracy
   - clarity
     (or the rubric defined by the teacher)

7. **Feedback Generation**
   The system produces:

   - question-level breakdown
   - suggestions for improvement
   - overall score

8. **Output Delivery**
   Results are displayed in the mobile app.

---

# ** How All Components Work Together**

This combined workflow shows the end-to-end flow of information through the system.

1. **User uploads document → OCR → normalized Sinhala text → embeddings stored**
2. **Student asks question (text or voice) → query processed → relevant passages retrieved**
3. **RAG model generates answer or summary → displayed to user**
4. **Student uploads answer → embeddings compared → grade + feedback sent back**

The modules remain independent but share embeddings and cleaned Sinhala text for consistency.

# ** Notes**

All PP1 materials including:

  are submitted separately following academic guidelines.

They are **not** stored inside this repository to keep the codebase light and organized.

## Troubleshooting
- **Blank UI / stuck loading**: Confirm backend is running and reachable at configured URL.
- **CORS errors**: Ensure CORS is enabled for your frontend origin in FastAPI settings.
- **Database errors**: Check PostgreSQL and Qdrant containers are running and accessible.
- **Uploads failing**: Backend must support `multipart/form-data` for uploads.
- **Auth issues**: Verify token refresh endpoint and JWT secret configuration.
