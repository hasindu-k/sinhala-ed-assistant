Team Responsibilities

The work is divided into four main functional areas. Each member is responsible for one part and supports the integration work.

1. Sinhala Document Processing (OCR + Preprocessing)

Handles printed and handwritten Sinhala text.
• Image cleaning
• Sinhala OCR
• Text normalization

2. Sinhala Q&A and Summaries (RAG Pipeline)

Takes student questions as text, searches resources, and produces answers tied to teacher notes.
• Embeddings
• Semantic search
• Source-bound answers
• Summaries

3. Voice-Based Q&A (Speech Recognition + Voice Output)

Handles Sinhala voice queries using speech recognition models and generates spoken answers.
• Voice capture
• Sinhala ASR
• Intent detection
• Text-to-speech

4. Automatic Answer Evaluation (IT22003478 – Miyuri)

Grades Sinhala student answers using uploaded resources.
• OCR for answer images if needed
• Semantic comparison
• Rubric-based scoring
• Question-wise and paper-wise feedback

# **📘 Component Workflows (Detailed Descriptions)**

This section explains how each major component of the Sinhala Ed Assistant works.
Each workflow focuses on the main steps the system follows when handling a user request.

---

# **1. Sinhala Document Processing Workflow (OCR + Embeddings)**

This module prepares printed or handwritten Sinhala educational content so the rest of the system can use it.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Document Input**
   A student or teacher uploads a scanned page, image, or handwritten note.

2. **Preprocessing**
   The system applies noise removal, resizing, deskewing, and contrast correction to improve recognition quality.

3. **Sinhala OCR Execution**
   The processed image is passed through a Sinhala-trained OCR engine.
   Output: raw Sinhala text.

4. **Text Normalization**
   Cleaning steps include Unicode fixes, spacing correction, and handling compound characters.

5. **Embedding Generation**
   The cleaned text is converted to semantic vectors using Sinhala-compatible embedding models.

6. **Storage in Vector Database**
   The embeddings and metadata are stored for later retrieval during Q&A, summarization, or answer evaluation.

---

# **2. Resource-Based Q&A and Summary Workflow (RAG Pipeline)**

This module retrieves relevant passages from teacher materials and produces source-grounded answers or summaries.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **User Input (Sinhala Text Query)**
   The student types a question into the mobile app.

2. **Query Normalization**
   The text is standardized to reduce Sinhala spelling and morphology variations.

3. **Query Embedding**
   The normalized question is converted into a semantic vector.

4. **Hybrid Retrieval**
   The system performs:

   * **BM25 retrieval** for keyword-exact passages
   * **Dense retrieval** for semantic matching
   * **Re-ranking** using pseudo-questions (via QuIM-style method)

5. **Context Selection**
   The top-ranked passages from teacher resources are selected.

6. **Answer / Summary Generation**
   The model generates:

   * **Source-bound answer**, or
   * **Condensed summary**, depending on user intent.

7. **Output Delivery**
   The mobile app receives the answer with optional reference indicators.

---

# **3. Voice-Based Q&A Workflow (Speech Input → Text → Answer → Display Output)**

This module handles Sinhala voice questions with accent-aware processing.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Voice Capture**
   The user speaks a Sinhala question using the app microphone.

2. **Speech Recognition (ASR)**
   The audio is transcribed into Sinhala text using a fine-tuned Whisper model.

3. **Intent Classification**
   The system identifies whether the user requests:

   * a direct answer
   * or a summary.

4. **RAG Processing**
   The recognized text is forwarded to the RAG module for retrieval and answer generation.

5. **Sinhala Text Response**
   The system produces a source-grounded answer.

6. **Output Delivery**
   The app displays the text response.

---

# **4. Automatic Answer Evaluation Workflow**

This module grades student answers based on semantic similarity to teacher-provided material.

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **Answer Submission**
   A student inputs an answer as typed text or uploads a photo.

2. **OCR (Only for Images)**
   The image is processed and converted into text using the same OCR pipeline used for documents.

3. **Text Preparation**
   The extracted text is cleaned and split into segments.

4. **Embedding Generation**
   Embeddings are produced for:

   * the student answer
   * the expected answer
   * the key points from teacher notes

5. **Semantic Comparison**
   The system checks:

   * matched concepts
   * partially correct ideas
   * missing points
   * irrelevant or incorrect statements

6. **Rubric-Based Evaluation**
   Scores are calculated based on:

   * coverage
   * accuracy
   * clarity
     (or the rubric defined by the teacher)

7. **Feedback Generation**
   The system produces:

   * question-level breakdown
   * suggestions for improvement
   * overall score

8. **Output Delivery**
   Results are displayed in the mobile app.

# **🧩 How All Components Work Together**

This combined workflow shows the end-to-end flow of information through the system.

1. **User uploads document → OCR → normalized Sinhala text → embeddings stored**
2. **Student asks question (text or voice) → query processed → relevant passages retrieved**
3. **RAG model generates answer or summary → displayed to user**
4. **Student uploads answer → embeddings compared → grade + feedback sent back**

The modules remain independent but share embeddings and cleaned Sinhala text for consistency.
